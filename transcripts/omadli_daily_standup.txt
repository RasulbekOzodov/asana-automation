Omadli Daily Standup
The Omadli Daily Standup meeting focused on key updates, project priorities, and ongoing challenges faced by the team. Zulfiya highlighted the urgency of the storm water project and the need to finalize workflows for ongoing initiatives like Textbrite and Archimedes, while also planning recruitment for additional research and automation support. The discussion on AI implementation stressed optimizing SQL queries with tools like GitHub Copilot and suggested an 'installment refresh' approach for database queries. Team members then updated their progress on various tasks, with specific action items assigned to individuals, including scheduling bi-weekly AI lab sessions, completing reports, and ensuring consistent API access for weather data. Emphasis was placed on learning about AI and sharing ideas to cultivate a collaborative culture.
