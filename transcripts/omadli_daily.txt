Omadli daily
In the daily Omadli meeting, Zulfiya outlined new client assignments, including a pool fencing client, and reviewed upcoming calls, emphasizing workflow allocation and follow-ups on recent meetings with Techsprite and Stormwater. The team discussed the importance of detailed workflow documentation, specifically for the Archimedes project, where the need to track inventory across various platforms was highlighted. Attention was given to the automation strategy, particularly for platforms lacking API access, and task assignments were distributed, including Fireflies integration work for Timurbek and documentation tasks for Suhrob. Development updates included progress on Salient UI and integrations involving APIs, with a clear focus on transitioning from OpenAI to Azure OpenAI. Action items were assigned to ensure clarity in workflows and project prioritization moving forward.
